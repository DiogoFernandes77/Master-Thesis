However, when the rotational speed is changing, the frequency bandwidth of each individual harmonic becomes wider.
 Because each individual harmonic bandwidth becomes wider as the speed changes, some frequency components might overlap.
  The resulting FFT power spectrum becomes blurred and can no longer help you identify characteristic vibration components
